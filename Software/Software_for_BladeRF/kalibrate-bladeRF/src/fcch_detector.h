 * This is based on the algorithm found in the paper,

 *	Frequency Burst Detection Algorithm for GSM / GPRS."
 *
 * The algorithm uses an adaptive filter to calculate the error difference from
 * a pure tone.  When the error goes low, the tone is detected.  When it goes
 * back high, the scan function returns and indicates the number of samples the
 * error was low.
